I have implemented Linear Regression algorithm with Rust language and compared performance with Python Numpy implementation. Performance of Rust implementation is approximately equal to Numpy implementation. 

In Rust implementation, I used ndrray and enabled BLAS support for matrix multiplication

For testing implementation, I have used datasets(ex1data1.txt and ex1data2.txt) provided on Coursera Machine Learning course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
